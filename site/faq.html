                Why does some plastic get stuck near shore?<br><br>
                <i>Currents can trap plastic in near shore areas. In real life, a lot of this plastic may wash up on the beach. Some plastic that ends up near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River would also likely flow out the river and towards the ocean.</i><br><br>
                Why does plastic often move to the east side of the lake so quickly?<br><br>
                <i>Lake Ontario is the last lake in the Great Lakes, as the current moves. Water from the other lakes flows into Lake Ontario in the west through the Niagara River, and drains into the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River in the east. This can cause strong west to east currents in the lake. </i><br><br>
                Why is there different behavior at different times of the year?<br><br>
                <i>Lake currents are influenced by the seasons and weather. This causes the differences in how plastic behaves in different seasons.</i><br><br>
